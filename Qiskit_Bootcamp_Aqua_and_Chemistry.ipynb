        "\n",
        "There has been a considerable amount of interest in recent times about the use of quantum computers to find a solution to combinatorial problems. It is important to say that, given the classical nature of combinatorial problems, exponential speedup in using quantum computers compared to the best classical algorithms is not guaranteed. However, due to the nature and importance of the target problems, it is worth investigating heuristic approaches on a quantum computer that could indeed speed up some problem instances. Here we demonstrate an approach that is based on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm by Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutman (2014). We frame the algorithm in the context of *approximate quantum computing*, given its heuristic nature. \n",
        "\n",
        "The Algorithm works as follows:\n",
        "1. Choose the $w_i$ and $w_{ij}$ in the target Ising problem. In principle, even higher powers of Z are allowed.\n",
        "2. Choose the depth of the quantum circuit $m$. Note that the depth can be modified adaptively.\n",
        "3. Choose a set of controls $\\theta$ and make a trial function $|\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\rangle$, built using a quantum circuit made of C-Phase gates and single-qubit Y rotations, parameterized by the components of $\\boldsymbol\\theta$. \n",
        "4. Evaluate $C(\\boldsymbol\\theta) = \\langle\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)~|H|~\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\rangle = \\sum_i w_i \\langle\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)~|Z_i|~\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\rangle+ \\sum_{i<j} w_{ij} \\langle\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)~|Z_iZ_j|~\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\rangle$ by sampling the outcome of the circuit in the Z-basis and adding the expectation values of the individual Ising terms together. In general, different control points around $\\boldsymbol\\theta$ have to be estimated, depending on the classical optimizer chosen. \n",
        "5. Use a classical optimizer to choose a new set of controls.\n",
        "6. Continue until $C(\\boldsymbol\\theta)$ reaches a minimum, close enough to the solution $\\boldsymbol\\theta^*$.\n",
        "7. Use the last $\\boldsymbol\\theta$ to generate a final set of samples from the distribution $|\\langle z_i~|\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\rangle|^2\\;\\forall i$ to obtain the answer.\n",
        "    \n",
        "It is our belief the difficulty of finding good heuristic algorithms will come down to the choice of an appropriate trial wavefunction. For example, one could consider a trial function whose entanglement best aligns with the target problem, or simply make the amount of entanglement a variable. In this tutorial, we will consider a simple trial function of the form\n",
        "\n",
        "$$|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle  = [U_\\mathrm{single}(\\boldsymbol\\theta) U_\\mathrm{entangler}]^m |+\\rangle$$\n",

        "where $U_\\mathrm{entangler}$ is a collection of C-Phase gates (fully entangling gates), and $U_\\mathrm{single}(\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n Y(\\theta_{i})$, where $n$ is the number of qubits and $m$ is the depth of the quantum circuit. The motivation for this choice is that for these classical problems this choice allows us to search over the space of quantum states that have only real coefficients, still exploiting the entanglement to potentially converge faster to the solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "One advantage of using this sampling method compared to adiabatic approaches is that the target Ising Hamiltonian does not have to be implemented directly on hardware, allowing this algorithm not to be limited to the connectivity of the device. Furthermore, higher-order terms in the cost function, such as $Z_iZ_jZ_k$, can also be sampled efficiently, whereas in adiabatic or annealing approaches they are generally impractical to deal with. \n",
